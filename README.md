## 0x0A Abeleton Clone
This is my first clone, it's just a beginner clone, it's not responsive at all, it took me 2 days to finish I struggle a lot but I finished it, I learned the box model, the position the grid and lot more. I'm proud of my self, because it's been just 1 week for me learning frontend and always remembe IHateFrontEnd.
